## Testing
* I tested the pages in different browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox
* I have confirm the web sites responsiveness and function on different devices like iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro Max, ipad Pro M1, Mac OS X
* I tested that and validated the navigation, header, about us (Home), gallery and contact us are easy to read and understand.
* I have confirm that all fields in the contact us are required and email field only accept email addresses, the submit button works.
* The Contact form uses Code Institute script for showing field submitted.

## Bugs
### Solved bugs
* One bug I noticed that was the use of section vs div and where to place id markers, the design changed due how section and div worked. Also section required by w3c validator that section should have h1-h6, but which I didn't want. So I solved it by using a div.
* Some minor spelling misstake was fixed

### Validator Testing
* HTML
- No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
* CSS
- No errors where found when passing through the offical (Jigsaw) validator
* Accessibility
* I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse (Chrome) in devtools
